## What's Web3 Platform?

The ideology of this repository is supposed to provide the boilerplate and features for marketplace applicaiton. Basically, this project is based on `create-t3-app` which can provide a bunch of features with REST APIs and tRPC based endpoints. Some of the UIs components are inherited from [MedusaJs](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa).

## Setting Database

Setting database is quite straightforward. You can download postgresql at [Postgres Download Page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install it in your local. Once the postgres was setup, you can add the proper connection url as the string at `.env`

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```
```
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

npm install or yarn install or bun install or pnpm install
```

## Running on local
